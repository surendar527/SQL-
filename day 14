/*
Query:  Write an SQL query to get the table in the form of kms travelled by the car on 
a given day and not the sum of the total distance?

Suppose you have a car travelling certain distance and the data is presented as follows -
Day 1 - 50 km
Day 2 - 100 km
Day 3 - 200 km

Now the distance is a cumulative sum as in
row2 = (kms travelled on that day + row1 kms).
